1.  stdint.h is a header file that allows programmers access to a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the min and max allowable values for each type.
2.  Using the following typedefs allows you to assign int variables with a predetermined size or width, meaning it occupies a certain amount of memory, no matter what.
3.  BYTE is 1 Byte, DWORD is 4 Bytes, LONG is 4 Bytes, and WORD is 2 Bytes.
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be BM in ASCII or 0x42 0x4D in Hexadecimal
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole BMP File while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER file and is constant as it is always equal to 40 Bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative, it means the BMP file is a top-down BIP with the origin at the upper left corner
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's bits per pixel or color depth
8.  fopen will return NULL in lines 24 or 32 of copy.c if you do not provide the command line with a valid infile and outfile.
9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 in our code because we are only reading 1 element/pixel at a time in this program.
10. Line 65 will add 3 to the padding if the bi.biWidth is 3 since the amount of bytes per scanline must be a multiple of 4.
11. fseek is a function that allows you to set a pointer at a specific file position by asking you how many bytes to moves the pointer
12. SEEK_CUR just means to start at the current pointer position when utilizing fseek.
